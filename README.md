## Key Functions
1. Image Loading: Loads images from various file formats, such as JPEG, PNG, or TIFF.
2. Resizing: Resizes images to a specified resolution or aspect ratio.
3. Normalization: Normalizes pixel values to a common range, such as 0-1 or -1 to 1, to improve model training and convergence.
4. Data Augmentation: Applies random transformations, such as rotation, flipping, or color jittering, to increase dataset diversity and prevent overfitting.
5. Noise Reduction: Removes noise or artifacts from images using techniques like Gaussian blurring or median filtering.
6. Contrast Enhancement: Enhances image contrast to improve visibility and feature extraction.

## Benefits
1. Improved Model Performance: Preprocessed images can lead to better model accuracy, precision, and recall.
2. Increased Robustness: Preprocessing techniques like data augmentation can help models generalize to new, unseen data.
3. Efficient Processing: Preprocessing can reduce the computational resources required for image analysis and feature extraction.

## Applications
1. Computer Vision: Image preprocessing is essential for various computer vision tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and recognition.
2. Machine Learning: Preprocessed images are used as input for machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
3. Image Analysis: Preprocessing is used in medical imaging, surveillance, and other applications where image analysis is critical.
